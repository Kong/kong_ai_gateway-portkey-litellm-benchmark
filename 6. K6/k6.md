# K6

Inside the K6's EC2 use the [Kong's K6 script](../k6/kong.js) to run the performance test:

```
k6 run kong.js
```

The script runs for 3 minute with 400 VUs. A VU is an independent thread of execution that runs concurrently to other VU threads. Often, scripts are designed in such a way that one VU activity represents that of one real user.
